	\section intro Introduction
	This program is a distributed bruteforce cryptographic hash cracker intended primarily for password recovery. It can also
	be used as a benchmark of raw integer performance on both CPUs and nVidia GPUs.
	
	The current version only compiles for Linux, however all third-party libraries it uses are available for Windows and OS X
	and the codebase was designed with eventual porting in mind (using wrapper classes around threading APIs, etc.)
	
	The cracker was written by Andrew Zonenberg (http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zonena/) and the members of RPISEC (http://rpisec.net).
	It is free software; its use is governed by the BSD license below:

	\section errs Error handling
	The majority of functions do not return error values. If an error occurs, an exception of class std::string is thrown
	containing a human-readable error message, including the file and line of the source file where the error was detected.
	
	Example:
	<pre>
	Failed to open CUDA module file ptx/YUVDecode.ptx: no such file or directory
	File: /home/azonenberg/Documents/local/programming/cuvis/LowLevel.cpp
	Line: 293
	</pre>
	
	\section pholder Notes on *_placeholder.cpp files
	These empty files are automatically generated during compilation of CUDA kernels and are used by the build system.

	\section Acknowledgements
	
	TODO: Add whatever libcurl needs
